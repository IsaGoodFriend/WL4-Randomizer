# WL4-Randomizer

Hello!  This is basically the Readme.  I think... (that's what the title says, so I'm going with it)  I'll be honest,  I don't know how ReadMes work.  In short, this is a command line project.  Run this program over a Wario Land 4 Rom (is that the right way to say that?), and you'll get a new randomized rom ready to play on your local emulator!  If you don't know how to open up a command line program, look it up on YouTube.  Sorry...

# Features

This randomizer will randomize all blue gems (the 1,000 point ones), all chests (including CD and heart restores), keyzer, and the frog switch when available.  There's also some safety to prevent chests from spawning in places that are impossible to reach.

# TO-DO

Randomize doorways (swapping room order)

Randomizing enemies
