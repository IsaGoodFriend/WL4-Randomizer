# WL4-Randomizer
Wario Land 4 Randomizer

Hello!  This is basically the Readme.  I think... (that's what the title says, so I'm going with it)  I'll be honest,  I don't know how ReadMes work.  In short, this is a command line project.  Run this program over a Wario Land 4 Rom (is that the right way to say that?), and you'll get a new randomized rom ready to play on your local emulator!  If you don't know how to open up a command line program, look it up on YouTube.

This is also where I'll post my notes for what I wish to add and change logs.  When I remember to post change logs.

Features yet to be added:
Randomize doorways (swapping room order)
Randomizing enemies
